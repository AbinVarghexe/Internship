## 📊 Overview

This repository contains machine learning models and data analysis techniques applied to a restaurant dataset. The project includes predictive modeling, recommendation systems, and classification tasks using various machine learning algorithms.

## 📑 Dataset

The dataset (`Dataset .csv`) includes information about restaurants such as:

- Restaurant names and locations
- Cuisines offered
- Price ranges
- Customer ratings and reviews
- Geographic coordinates
- Table booking availability
- Online delivery options
- And more features

## 🛠️ Tasks & Notebooks

### Task 1: Restaurant Rating Prediction 📈

[`task_1.ipynb`](./task_1.ipynb): Linear regression model to predict restaurant ratings based on various features.


**Key Features:**
- Data exploration and visualization
- Feature engineering and preprocessing
- Linear regression modeling
- Performance evaluation using R² score
- Feature importance analysis

### Task 2: Restaurant Recommendation System 🍴

[`task_2.ipynb`](./task_2.ipynb): Interactive recommendation system that suggests restaurants based on user preferences.

**Key Features:**
- Content-based filtering
- User preference inputs via interactive widgets
- Cuisine, city, and price range filtering
